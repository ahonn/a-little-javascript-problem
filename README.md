## A little JavaScript problem

Solution of http://lisperator.net/blog/a-little-javascript-problem

### Problem
In fact, this isn't about JavaScript, but that's the context I've discussed it in. I encourage you to think about it in more programming languages. (are there languages in which this can't be done?)

The problem: define functions range, map, reverse and foreach, obeying the restrictions below, such that the following program works properly. It prints the squares of numbers from 1 to 10, in reverse order.

```js
var numbers = range(1, 10);
numbers = map(numbers, function (n) { return n * n });
numbers = reverse(numbers);
foreach(numbers, console.log);

/* output:

   100
   81
   64
   49
   36
   25
   16
   9
   4
   1
*/
```

##### Restrictions
You must not use arrays. The square bracket characters, [ and ], are forbidden, as well as Array constructor.

You must not use objects. The curly braces, { and }, and the dot character (.) are forbidden. You may use curly braces for code blocks, but not for creating JavaScript objects.

Should go without saying, these functions must be generic and do what their name implies. They must not be hard-coded for the particular 1..10 example.

Feel free to define utilities; you don't have to restrict your program to these 4 functions. It does not matter how fast, small or elegant it is â€” if you can do it within the limitations above, I think you're an above-average programmer and I would probably hire you. (however: I'm not hiring)

Just for reference, my implementation (in ES6) is 8 lines of code, and it isn't totally unreadable. :-)

### Solutions

#### Generator
Implemented by JavaScript Generator

```js
function* range(start, end) {
  for (let i = start; i <= end; i += 1) {
    yield i;
  }
}

function* map(collection, iteratee = (id) => id) {
  for (const item of collection) {
    yield iteratee(item);
  }
}

function* reverse(collection) {
  for (const item of collection) {
    yield* reverse(collection);
    yield item;
  }
}

function foreach(collection, iteratee = (id) => id) {
  for (const item of collection) {
    iteratee(item);
  }
}
```

#### CPS
Implemented By CPS

```js
function range(start, end) {
  return (cont) => {
    for (let i = start; i <= end; i += 1) {
      cont(i);
    }
  };
}

function map(collection, iteratee) {
  return (cont) => {
    collection((i) => cont(iteratee(i)));
  };
}

function reverse(collection) {
  return (cont) => {
    let f = () => void 0;
    collection((i) => {
      ((g) => (f) = () => g(cont(i)))(f);
    });
    f();
  };
}

function foreach(collection, iteratee) {
  collection(iteratee);
}
```
